## Maegan Wyrzykowski's About Me Website

My website is a fully responsive site all about me! Using different framework templates and coding techniques learned throughout the past few weeks, I was able to create a website using my own styling. With my website, you can view 3 different pages, all linked in the navbar. You can read my "about me", view a pending portfolio page, and contact me directly.
